# Banking Ops Jira Automation

This repository contains the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document and related files for the **Banking Operations Jira Automation** project. The project demonstrates automation of task management and workflow rules within Jira, specifically tailored for banking operations teams.

## Project Overview

The automation rules in this project streamline task triage, priority labelling, assignment, reminders for stale tasks, and auto-closing of resolved issues. These rules enhance operational efficiency, SLA compliance, and business process governance.

## Confluence SOP Document

The detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document is hosted on Atlassian Confluence, a widely-used team collaboration and documentation platform. This Confluence page provides:

- A structured, easy-to-navigate explanation of automation logic, triggers, conditions, and validation testing  
- Real-time access to the latest version of the SOP for stakeholders and auditors  
- A professional environment commonly used in banking and operations teams for documenting workflows and rules  

You can view the SOP on Confluence here:
