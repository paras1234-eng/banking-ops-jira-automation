**Banking Ops Jira Automation**
This repository contains the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document and related files for the Banking Operations Jira Automation project. The project demonstrates automation of task management and workflow rules within Jira, specifically tailored for banking operations teams.

**Project Overview**
The automation rules in this project streamline task triage, priority labelling, assignment, reminders for stale tasks, and auto-closing of resolved issues. These rules enhance operational efficiency, SLA compliance, and business process governance.

**Confluence SOP Document**

A structured, easy-to-navigate explanation of automation logic, triggers, conditions, and validation testing
Real-time access to the latest version of the SOP for stakeholders and auditors
A professional environment commonly used in banking and operations teams for documenting workflows and rules
